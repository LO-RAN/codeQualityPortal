      <p>During its life time, every task goes through a number of states. This
        makes it possible to trace exactly where every task is, which in turn
        enables consistent and reliable execution of the business processes that
        the tasks are part of.</p>
      <p>Below is a schematic overview of the states a task can be in. The arrows
        indicate how a task can travel from one state to another. Some transitions
        are done automatically, while others can be performed by you, the user.
        Every state has a specific purpose, which is discussed in the next section.</p>

              assigned to one or more actors (i.e. users that can execute the
              task). From this moment on the task can appear on task lists. When
              you see a task in this state, you can do two things: reserve it
              for later execution (see below) or execute it directly (in which
              case the task will be reserved for you automatically).</p>

                     to claim the task for later execution.This may happen when the user
                     was previously involved in the case and wants to prevent others
                     from executing this particular task. When you have reserved a task
                     and placed it in this state, others will not be able to see or execute
                     it, until you release it of course (i.e. place it back in the 'Scheduled'
                     state). </p>

              Starting the task can be done by clicking on the 'Execute' button
              or on the task title. The appropriate application will be started
              automatically. When you finish the task, it will automatically place
              itself into the 'Completed' state. When an error occurs, it will
              be placed into the 'Failed' state.</p>

                     is the signal for the workflow software to create the next task
                     in the process and assign it to the relevant actors (i.e. place
                     it in the 'Scheduled' state). Tasks that are completed can still
                     be retrieved for reference purposes until they are archived.</p>

                  <p>When a task could not be properly completed by the application,
                     it may signal this by placing the task in the 'Failed' state. This
                     doesn't necessarily mean that there is a serious problem. It just
                     means that something went wrong. You can try to solve the problem
                     or just try to execute it again. However, to make sure that you
                     don't overlook the situation, you need to first reset the task into
                     the 'Reserved' state. </p>

            <p>When for some reason the task should not be executed at all, you
                     may indicate so by placing the task in state 'Aborted'. This may
                     happen for instance when a customer had previously called in to
                     report a problem (which started a business process), but later on
                     decided that the problem had already disappeared. In such a case,
                     the task at hand may be aborted, even when it is already in the
                     'Executing' state, and the complete process will be halted.</p>
